blouchapp
=========

a blog couchapp!  for fun.

Not much of an install...

clone repository
git clone https://github.com/deathbearbrown/blouchapp.git

cd blouchapp

npm install couchapp



\o/ I have no idea if it was wise to check in the jam stuff


when you want to push to couch

couchapp push app.js [http of your couch repo or cloudant account]/appname


SETTING PERMISSIONS IN CLOUDANT

On the new dashboard, if you don't see 'nobody' under logged in users, add it. Set permissions to read and write.
